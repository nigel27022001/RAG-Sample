RAG stands for **"Red, Amber, Green"**, and it's a simple traffic-light system used for risk assessment and management. 

The categories are straightforward:

* **Red:**  Indicates **high risk**. Action is required immediately to mitigate the risk. 
* **Amber:** Indicates **medium risk**. Action is needed, but it can be planned and implemented in a timely manner.
* **Green:** Indicates **low risk**.  The situation is under control and requires minimal monitoring. 

**Here's how RAG is typically used:**

* **Risk Assessment:**  RAG colors can be assigned to different risks based on their likelihood and impact.
* **Project Management:**  RAG can be used to track the progress of tasks, milestones, and deliverables.
* **Financial Reporting:**  RAG can be applied to financial indicators, such as revenue, expenses, and profitability.
* **Health and Safety:**  RAG can be used to assess the safety of work environments and procedures.

**In summary, RAG is a simple and effective tool for categorizing risk levels and guiding decision-making.**
